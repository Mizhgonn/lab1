<h2> Petropavl History </h2>
<p> Petropavl is the second oldest oblast center in northern Kazakhstan after <a href="https://aboutkazakhstan.com/pavlodar-city">Pavlodar</a>.

In 1740 Russian government approved the project on creating a new chain of military fortifications 558 km long - from Tobol River to Omsk fortress on Irtysh River. In June 1752 an expedition of almost 2,000 people headed for Ishim River. The expedition was to construct a large St. Peter fortification within a short period of time. Need in bread and forage promoted peasants inhabiting lands around the fortress. Soldiers and dragoons also had the right to build their own houses outside the fortress.

Like other fortifications in Siberia St. Peter’s fortress was strengthening its military importance. Merchants class was growing as the fortress was becoming a large political and economic center of the region. It was there that trade ways from Russia and Middle Asia came together.

In 1807 the fortification was renamed into Petropavlovsk town. In 19th century the town still preserving its military importance turned into large center of trade and economic as well as spiritual ties among Kirghiz (Kazakh) and Russian people. Development of the town was favored by migration of peasants from European Russia and the construction of Siberian railway.

Since 1936 Petropavlovsk has been the regional center of North Kazakhstan oblast of Kazakh SSR and since 1991 of Kazakhstan Republic. </p>
